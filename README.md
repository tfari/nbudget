# nbudget
Terminal front-end for budget database via [Notion API]("https://developers.notion.com/"). 

Allows user to insert records into a simple budget database, and to query the current tag names in it.

![](https://github.com/tfari/nbudget/blob/main/nbudget_animation.gif)

## Requirements:
* A shared Notion database formatted as shown in Setup
* A Notion API key to access said database
* At first run, the script will prompt the user to generate a settings file, asking for the database's ID,
and the API key to access it, populating the rest of the options with default values.

## Usage:
```
nbudget.py [-h] [-w] [-t] [-i] [-d DATE] CONCEPT AMOUNT [TAG [TAG ...]]

Interface for a simple budget database in Notion using Notion's API. The database needs to be structured as follows:
Type(select), Date(date), Concept(title), Amount(number), Tags(multi_select). The names of each column can be others (as
long as the types are respected), but you will have to edit the settings.json file so the script knows their new names.

positional arguments:
  CONCEPT               The concept for the record.
  AMOUNT                The amount value for the record.
  TAG                   A tag or tags for the record. Must be valid tags, if unsure, run "nbudget.py -t"

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w, --wizard          Run the settings wizard and exit.
  -t, --tags            Output the current tag names in the database and exit.
  -i, --income          Record is considered an income instead of an expense.
  -d DATE, --date DATE  The date to use for the expense record, if not used the current day will be used.
```

The only required arguments are **CONCEPT** and **AMOUNT**, as date will default to the current day's date,
and income to "EXPENSE".

## Setup:

The Notion database must contain the following columns:
* Type (select) -> Must have two options: "INCOME" and "EXPENSE"
* Date (date)
* Concept (title)
* Amount (number, formatted as Dollar)
* Tags (multiselect) -> Can have any options the User choses

The names of these columns can be altered, but should be specified in the settings.json file. New
columns can be added without issues, but the script would need to be altered if the user wants to
fill them in through the utility.

The instructions to share the database and get an API key for it are specified [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs)

## Settings
The settings.json file specifies the following possible setting configurations:

* database_id: The database's id.
* api_key: The Notion API key to access said database.
* date_input_format: Any variation of `D/M/Y`. Default is `D/M/Y`
* tag_separator: The separator for tags when running `-t`. Default is `\n`
* type_name: The name of the Type column. Defaults is `Type`
* date_name: The name of the Date column. Defaults is `Date`
* concept_name: The name of the Concept column. Defaults is `Concept`
* amount_name: The name of the Amount column. Default is `Amount`
* tags_name: The name of the Tags column. Default is `Tags`

## Interface
The module provides the following public interfaces:

```

    """
    :param database_id: str, A valid Notion's database id accessible via the api_key.
    :param api_key: str, A valid Notion's api_key that has access to the database under database_id.
    :returns: dict, A default settings dictionary with the users information.
    :raises TypeError: if database_id or api_key are not string objects.
